## Solution descriptions

First, define the values for a, b, and c, and the function ax\^2 + b + c = 0.

Then, I have to consider the number of possible of values of 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, I have to first check whether b\^2 - 4ac is negative. If so, there would be no solution. Otherwise, solve the quadratic equation and plot it.

## Code

```{r}
#| echo: false
a <- 1
b <- 3
c <- 2

f <- function(x) {
    return(a*x^2 + b*x +c)
}

if (b^2 - 4*a*c <0) {
  print ("There is no solution, and I don't know how to make a graph that makes sense, sorry!")
  
  minx <- (c-b^2/(4*a))
  
  plot(f, from=-100, to=100)
  abline(h = 0)
} else {
  
  x1 <- (-b + (sqrt(b^2-4*a*c)))/(2*a)
  x2 <- (-b - (sqrt(b^2-4*a*c)))/(2*a)
  
  if (x1 == x2) {
    print(paste("To solve this equation, x =", x1))
  } else {
    print(paste("To solve this equation, x =", x1, "or x =", x2))
  }
  
  plot(f, from=x2-1, to=x1+1)
  abline(h = 0)
}

```
